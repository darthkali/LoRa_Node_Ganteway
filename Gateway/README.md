### Software

- Raspberry Pi Operation System [link and instruction below]
- Single Channel LoRaWAN Gateway [link and instruction below] [deprecated]



## Installation
> First we need to Install the RaspberryPi OS

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

> Linux
```bash
sudo apt install rpi-imager
```

> Windows
Download it from this Page:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

or use Chocolatey [[Whats this?](https://chocolatey.org/why-chocolatey)]
```bash

choco install rpi-imager
```
Setup Raspberry
Use raspi-config to enable SPI:


```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

- Select 5 Interfacing Options:
- Select P2 [SSH] and P4 [SPI]:
- Select *Yes*

- reboot

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```

### Setup the Raspberry Pi Software



1) Login to Raspberry Pi as the Pi user
2) Clone the repo [in root folder]
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tftelkamp/single_chan_pkt_fwd
```
3) Install wiringPi:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
```


## Config
1) go to the single channel gateway code:

```bash
cd ~/single_chan_pkt_fwd
```

2) open main.cpp to configurate the LoRa Gateway
```bash
nano main.cpp
```

3) Change some stuff
- Find the line:
```bash
#define SERVER1 "54.72.145.119" // The Things Network: croft.thethings.girovito.nl
```

- Replace the IP with your chosen Server-IP:
> the following list is from the 21.10.2020 so maybe this is changed in the meantime. if you Gateway dosnÂ´t work, please check the following site and search for the correct IP: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/packet-forwarder/semtech-udp.html
